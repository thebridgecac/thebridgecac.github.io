a reasonable effort to learn and retain the information presented in this training. the reasonable effort includes, but is not limited to: reading and/or hearing all content of a section completely

law texas law requires that any person suspecting that a child has been abused or neglected must immediately make a report. if there is an emergency, call 911 and then call the dfps texas abuse hotline at 1-800-252-5400. you can also make a report online at www.txabusehotline.org. professionals must make a report no later than the 48th hour after first suspecting a child has been abused or neglected or is a victim of an offense under section 21.11, penal code. a professional may not delegate to or rely on another person to make the report (texas family code, section 261.101). professionals are not required to follow up their oral reports with a written report as they were in the past. professionals include teachers, nurses, doctors, day-care employees and others who are either licensed by the state or work in a facility licensed or operated by the state and who have direct contact with children in the course of their job (texas family code, section 261.101). it is important to make the report as soon as possible. the more time that passes between the incident and your report, the more difficult it is for cps to conduct an appropriate and thorough investigation and to gather the information needed to protect the child. over time, bruises can heal; physical evidence may disappear or be obscured; memories may fade; and children, parents and other individuals may change their minds about what to say to cps. in some situations, you may be aware of a family’s ongoing problems over a period of time before you begin to suspect that the situation has worsened into abuse or neglect. dfps encourages you to report if you think that a child has been abused or neglected. you are not expected to prove that abuse or neglect has definitely occurred. delaying your report to check the situation or to gather more information can result in more serious harm to the child. information from www.dfps.state.tx.us
